## `taxumap.py`

* On the topic of `fill_taxonomy` function
    1. Should we just put up a warning, and then direct the user to the documentation?
    
    In the documentation, we can easily show them what to do ... all data is different

    For people just "trying out" the software, maybe just put an old version of the tax filling function within the "tools" .py file
